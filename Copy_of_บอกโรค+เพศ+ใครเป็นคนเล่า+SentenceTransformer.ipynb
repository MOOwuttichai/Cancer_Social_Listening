Sorry to hear about your bad news. I am a retired physician. I do not know the details of your case but I suspect that there was some miscommunication of some kind. Do not accept the nurse's assessment of your situation as the final word. If you have MyChart I would reach out to the Oncologist and ask about this in terms of possible miscommunication or possibly being confused about what the nurse said. You should also be given the chance to speak with the Radiation Oncologist as the expert on Friday at your appointment. I would place far more faith in what the Radiation Oncologist says. I had spinal lesions causing sciatica and had the start of motor weakness. I received radiation to the spine which reversed the pain and my motor strength has returned to normal. It seems to me if you have been told you might be paralyzed by this lesion that someone should have done a motor exam on you (formally tested your strength right now). As you are reaching out to the Oncologist and your PCP you might ask if anyone is concerned enough that you should have a motor exam or be placed on steroids awaiting the radiation (if both haven't already been done). In my case I was placed on high dose steroids awaiting the first radiation treatment. I suspect they might do the same for you. Good luck. This is part of what makes cancer so fun. Even as a physician I find the communication issues maddening.\",\n          \"I\\u2019m so sorry that you have to go through this. What I suspect the nurse said was \\u201csingle fraction\\u201d rather than \\u201c single section\\u201d. Each radiation dose is called a fraction, and they\\u2019re usually spaced apart in time so that the healthy cells have time to recover but the cancer cells don\\u2019t. Definitely see a radiation oncologist, and they can explain why it\\u2019s a single fraction. Best of luck with your treatment.\",\n          \"I'm sorry to hear this, but here's some hope: I had cancer in many bones, but had radiation on the worse of them: hips, pelvis and femurs (I ended up breaking one femur in the middle of radiation, but the rest of the bone mets disappeared.

              "{1: [\"Wow. Sorry to hear about your bad news. I am a retired physician. I do not know the details of your case but I suspect that there was some miscommunication of some kind. Do not accept the nurse's assessment of your situation as the final word. If you have MyChart I would reach out to the Oncologist and ask about this in terms of possible miscommunication or possibly being confused about what the nurse said. You should also be given the chance to speak with the Radiation Oncologist as the expert on Friday at your appointment. I would place far more faith in what the Radiation Oncologist says. I had spinal lesions causing sciatica and had the start of motor weakness. I received radiation to the spine which reversed the pain and my motor strength has returned to normal. It seems to me if you have been told you might be paralyzed by this lesion that someone should have done a motor exam on you (formally tested your strength right now). As you are reaching out to the Oncologist and your PCP you might ask if anyone is concerned enough that you should have a motor exam or be placed on steroids awaiting the radiation (if both haven't already been done). In my case I was placed on high dose steroids awaiting the first radiation treatment. I suspect they might do the same for you. Good luck. This is part of what makes cancer so fun. Even as a physician I find the communication issues maddening.\",\n",
              "  'Dirkwoods … Your observations are quite informative and make a great deal of sense. Best to you. … Maddening is the key word for OP’s situation with a nurse (an NP in action?) blathering about paralysis based only on on a scan.',\n",

              "  \"I'm so sorry to hear this. For me, it was the other way round. CC spread to my spine and then to my lungs. But my spine is fine now. I get chemo+immunotherapy for my lungs. Have you talked to a neurosurgeon yet? They basically removed my T1 vertebrae, put some titanium plate in, then did 22 rounds of radiation and after that it was gone from my spine and still is. Don't listen to what an oncology nurse tells you, speak to the specialists whos job it is to treat cancer to the spine. Good luck!\",\n",

But I have to point out that sometimes my nurse could say things that turned out differently so I think the best thing is always to talk to your oncologist. I think its very easy for miscommunication and ultimatley, our nurses arent the experts on our cancer. They’re knowledgeable and have experience sure, but that doesnt make them experts like the oncologists. Also, I’ve had cancer in my spine, which even caused a fracture and compression (basically the entire vertebra is ruined and my spine is instable). But nobody said anything about getting paralyzed. Sounds so strange your nurse would just call you and tell you over the phone. Also, I believe surgery usually is an option for spine mets, especially to prevent paralysis. I hope you get more clear answers soon!',\n",

I had a catscan at the end of last month that indicated new liver and lung mets, and at my next follow up my Oncologist suggested she call an ambulance and get me to the hospital because I was having severe pain in my back, abdomen, pelvis and groin. I declined and drove to the hospital because it's literally right behind her office. I had a catscan guided biopsy for my abdomen where they found a 10cm tumor that was entirely new. When the MRI came back on my spine it showed a 3cm tumor with extensions into the soft tissue around L2. They contacted radiology and scheduled me for 5 treatments that ended on Thursday. The pain is a little better (being on the radiation table was the worst). And I'm told the tumor is dying. So the 10cm tumor in my abdomen was impinging upon my ureters coming from both kidneys, and yesterday they put Stents in to open them up. My back pain has improved.
